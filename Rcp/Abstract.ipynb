    "We report STAR measurements of the nuclear modification factor R$_{CP}$ for identified $\\pi^{+(-)}$, K$^{+(-)}$, and p ($\\bar{p}$) for Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{S_{NN}}$= 14.5 GeV. Multiple PID detectors are simultaneously employed to extract exclusive particle yields out to a pT of 3.5 GeV/c. The R$_{CP}$ of K$^{+(-)}$ and p ($\\bar{p}$) show a transition from suppression at low pT in the $N_{part}$ scaling region to enhancement at high pT in the $N_{coll}$ scaling region. The $\\pi^{+(-)}$ R$_{CP}$ shows suppression at low pT and remains near unity above 2 GeV/c."

    "When coupled with a strong magnetic field produced in heavy-ion collisions, the chirality imbalance in local domains can lead to the electric charge separation along the magnetic field direction, manifested as chiral magnetic effect (CME). Recently, an analogous effect, the chiral vortical effect(CVE) was also theorized, in which the vorticity of the collision system replaces the magnetic field, and a baryonic charge separation appears instead of the electric charge separation.\n",

    "Data from multiple PID detectors are simultaneously used to extract exclusive particle yields out to a pT of 3.5 GeV/c.  The spectra and R$_{CP}$ measurements will be discussed in the context of previously presented BES measurements. Four case studies will be reported to explore possible hierarchy structure in the particle dependent correlations due to CME and CVE : proton-$K^0_s$ (no CME/CVE), proton-$\\pi^{\\pm}$(CME only), proton-$\\Lambda$(CVE only), and proton-proton(both CME and CVE). These measurements present a good test to see if the CME/CVE expectation is supported by the data with a charge separation ordering(p − p $\\gt$ p − $\\Lambda$ $\\gt$p − $\\pi^{\\pm}$$\\gt$p − $K^0_s$ ~0)."
