    "- **Elastic Collision:**\n",
    "    A collision between particles A and B in which the amount of **kinetic energy** and the **number** of particles remains constant.   \n",
    "    For instance, A + B --> A + B : Two particles collide and two particles exit the collision with the same amount of **total** energy between the two of them.\n",
    "- **Inelastic Collision:**\n",
    "     A collision between particles in which the **kinetic energy** or **number** of particles is **not** conserved.   \n",
    "     Example 1) A + B --> A + B\\* where B absorbs some of the kinetic energy. Here Kinetic Energy is not conserved.  \n",
    "     Example 2) A + B --> A + C + D where A exits the collision but B breaks into two particles C and D. Here the number of particles is not conserved\n",
    "- **Solid Angle:**\n",
    "    The size that an object appears to an observer measured in 2D angles. For instance, when you stand close to the TV it looks big. The same TV looks small when you stand far away from it. The Solid Angle is how big the TV **looks** from where you are standing. The size of the TV never changes, but the TV looks like it changes size to you depending on where you stand.\n",
    "- **Impact Parameter:**\n",
    "    The distance between the centers of the two colliding objects. For two particles traveling in the x-direction, the y-distance between their centers is the impact parameter. Normally we use the variable *b* as the impact parameter\n",
